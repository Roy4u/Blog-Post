Humankind and art cannot function without one another. We have the burning desire to create, whatever it may be and however tiny or grand. The interaction with sound is unavoidable, either to make it or take pleasure in it. People have always found music significant in their lives, whether for enjoyment in listening, the emotional response, performing, or creating. This is no different for classical music or contemporary concert music. Both musics have immense worth for our society; however, the problem we all know in this field is that this music is little known and hence underappreciated. As a musician and artist it is my responsibility that others can learn to enjoy the art for which I have utter passion.</span></span><p></p><p style="background-color: #fafafa; margin-bottom: 1.6em; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">The most common way one becomes involved with music is through listening or attending a musical event. Listening at home on a CD player, or in the car, on the computer, or on an iPod can be a very personal and fulfilling experience. Music, as we know, sets a mood and a vibe as we hear it in lounges, bars, parties, or other social events. Also, attending a concert is unique as it offers the excitement of hearing live musicians while providing the sound as it is meant to be heard (if it is acoustic music that is). Where else can one sit with other people, listen, and enjoy music in (relative) silence so that there are no distractions besides the music itself?</span></p><p style="background-color: #fafafa; margin-bottom: 1.6em; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Music can also stimulate the mind. There are many things in music, to which one can listen and bring attention. One can be mindful of the melodies or themes, the harmony, the driving or relaxed rhythms, the color of the sounds, the activity of a piece, how the sounds are produced, or how they all relate to one another, all while, possibly figuring out how the composer conceived the piece. Focused and attentive listening is an incredible experience that allows one to be lost in a foreign sound world.</span></p><p style="background-color: #fafafa; margin-bottom: 1.6em; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word; text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="color: #ff00fe; font-family: Alfa Slab One;"> Music connects people with the God.</span></p><p style="background-color: #fafafa; margin-bottom: 1.6em; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word; text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span color="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)" style="font-family: georgia;"> </span><span style="font-family: Russo One;">Music can raise someoneâ€™s mood, get them excited, or make them calm and relaxed.</span></p><p style="background-color: #fafafa; margin-bottom: 1.6em; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word; text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: Russo One;">Music also - and this is important - allows us to feel nearly or possibly all emotions that we experience in our lives.</span></p><p style="background-color: #fafafa; margin-bottom: 1.6em; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word; text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: Russo One;">The possibilities are endless...</span></p><p style="background-color: #fafafa; margin-bottom: 1.6em; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word; text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: Russo One;"><br /></span></p><p><b>Contact me:</b></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/itz_roy4u/">Instagram</a><br /></p><p style="background-color: #fafafa; margin-bottom: 1.6em; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word; text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: Russo One;"></span></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100026307941175">Facebook</a></p>
